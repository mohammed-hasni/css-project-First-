    <h1>Sigiriya the ancient rock</h1>
    <p>
        Sigiriya or Sinhagiri (Lion Rock Sinhala: සීගිරිය, Tamil: சிகிரியா/சிங்ககிரி, pronounced 
        SEE-gi-ri-yə) is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the 
        town of Dambulla in the Central Province, 
        Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a 
        massive column of granite approximately 180 m (590 ft) high.[2]

        According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, 
        this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides 
        it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (CE 477–495) for
        his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated 
        its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side 
        of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this
        place is derived from this structure; Sinhagiri, the Lion Rock.

        The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's 
        death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.
        [3] Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one
        of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning.

    <h2>History Past</h2>
    <p>
        It is likely that the area around Sigiriya was inhabited since prehistoric times. 
        There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and 
        ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BCE. The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala 
        rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied circa 3000 BCE during the Mesolithic Period.
        <br>
        Buddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BCE in the western and northern slopes of the
         boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. 
         These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are 
         carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic 
         order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE.
         <br>
            In 477 CE, Kashyapa I, the king's son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup
             assisted by Migara, the King's nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled 
             to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional 
             capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa's reign (477–495 CE), Sigiriya was developed 
             into a complex city and fortress.[3][4] Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including
              defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.

The Cūḷavaṃsa describes King Kashyapa as the son of King Dhatusena. Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him up alive and then 
usurping the throne which rightfully belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena's son by the true queen. Moggallana fled to
 India to escape being assassinated by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and 
 retaking the throne of Sri Lanka, which he considered to be rightfully his. Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana, Kashyapa 
 is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a pleasure palace. Moggallana finally arrived, 
 declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495 CE. During the battle Kashyapa's armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword.

The Cūḷavaṃsa and folklore inform us that the war elephant on which Kashyapa was mounted changed course to take a strategic advantage, 
but the army misinterpreted the movement as the king's having opted to retreat, prompting the army to abandon him altogether. It is said 
that being too proud to surrender he took his dagger from his waistband, cut his throat, raised the dagger proudly, sheathed it, and fell dead.
 Moggallana returned the capital to Anuradhapura, converting Sigiriya into a Buddhist monastery complex,[5] which survived until the 13th or 14th century.
  After this period, no records are found on Sigiriya until the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used briefly as an outpost of the Kingdom of Kandy.
